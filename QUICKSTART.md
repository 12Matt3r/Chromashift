After the initial scene loads, you'll see:

**Four Starting Choices:**
1. **"Touch the liquid floor"** → Experience mercury contact and memory reflections
2. **"Stare at the blinking mascot"** → Commune with a sentient cereal box entity

## 🎯 Tips for Maximum Immersion

### 1. Use Headphones (Optional)
While ChromaShift doesn't have audio yet, the quiet can enhance the dreamlike atmosphere

### 2. Dim Your Room Lights
The high-brightness visuals work best in a darker environment

### 3. Take Your Time
Don't rush through choices—read the descriptions fully to appreciate the surrealism

### 4. Explore All Branches
Try different choice combinations to discover unique scenarios

### 5. Embrace the Absurdity
Nothing makes sense here—that's the point. Let go of logic.

### 6. Full Screen for Best Effect
Press F11 (Windows) or Cmd+Ctrl+F (Mac) to enter fullscreen mode

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Black Screen After Loading
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Problem: Images Not Loading
**Solution**:
- Ensure `imgs/` folder is in same directory as `index.html`
- Check that image files exist: `supermarket_dreamscape_7.png`, etc.
- If images still fail, the system will generate a procedural panorama

### Problem: Choice Bubbles Don't Respond
**Solution**:
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled
- Check that `chromashift.js` loaded properly (browser console)
- Try refreshing the page (F5)

### Problem: Panorama Won't Rotate
**Solution**:
- Click and drag on the panorama area
- Ensure you're not clicking UI elements
- Try using mouse instead of trackpad

### Problem: Low Performance / Laggy
**Solution**:
- Close other browser tabs
- Update your graphics drivers
- Lower browser zoom to 100%
- Use a device with better GPU

## 🔍 Understanding Choice Outcomes

### Each Choice Has:
- **New Scene Title**: Describes the new surreal state
- **Elaborate Description**: 3-4 paragraphs of dream logic
- **New WTF Moment**: A fresh impossibility

### Example Chain:
```
START: Supermarket Aisle 7
  ↓ [Lick the melting clock radio]
Temporal Taste Test [Clock Consumption]
  ↓ [Open an envelope from the future]
Future Correspondence [Temporal Mail]
  ↓ [Read the letter addressed to you]

```

### No Two Playthroughs Are Identical
The order you choose creates unique narrative branches

## 📖 Lore & Context (Optional Reading)

### What is the Chroma-Dream?
A hyper-vivid, reality-bending state where your subconscious mind distorts urban environments. You're not "playing a game"—you're exploring your own consciousness rendered as a surreal cityscape.

### Who is the Protagonist?
An everyman/woman with no backstory or motivation. You are simply **awareness** moving through impossible spaces.

### Is There a Goal?
**No.** ChromaShift has:
- ❌ No mission to complete
- ❌ No story to finish
- ❌ No ending to reach
- ✅ Only exploration, reaction, and experience

### What Are the Themes?
- **Dreams vs. Reality**: What is real when logic breaks down?
- **Identity Fragmentation**: Multiple selves, alternate timelines
- **Temporal Nonsense**: Time as a physical substance you can consume
- **Urban Surrealism**: Everyday places made impossible
- **Subconscious Exploration**: Your mind reflecting itself
